<h3>ingrediants</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 tsp active dry yeast</li>
<li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
<li>¾ cup warm water (105°F–110°F or 40°C–43°C)</li>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
<li>¾ tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for the bowl <li>
<h4>for the sause </h4>
<li>½ cup crushed canned tomatoes or tomato puree</li>
</li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
<li>¼ tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>Pinch of salt and black pepper</li>
<h4>For The Toppings</h4>
<li>4-6 oz shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>Desired toppings: e.g., pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, onions, mushrooms</li>
<li>Fresh basil for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Activate the yeast: In a large bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir gently and let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. If it doesn't foam, the yeast is likely expired, and you should start over with a fresh packet</li>
<li>Combine ingredients: Add the flour, salt, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the yeast mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon or your hands until a shaggy dough forms</li>
<li>Knead the dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for about 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
<li>Let it rise: Grease a clean large bowl with olive oil and place the dough ball inside, turning to coat it. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Place it in a warm spot and let it rise until it doubles in size, which typically takes 1 to 2 hours</li>
<li>Punch down: Once doubled, gently punch the dough down to release the air bubbles</li>
<li>Make the sauce: In a small bowl, mix the crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, salt, and pepper. This is a no-cook sauce; simply mix and spread.</li>
<li>Preheat oven: Preheat your oven to its highest possible temperature (ideally 450°F to 500°F or 230°C to 260°C) for at least 30 minutes. If you have a pizza stone or cast-iron skillet, place it in the oven while preheating for a crispier crust.</li>
<li>Shape the dough: On a lightly floured surface, roll or stretch the dough ball into a round shape, about 10-12 inches in diameter. Leave the edges slightly thicker for the crust.</li>
<li>Assemble the pizza: Transfer the stretched dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet dusted with cornmeal or flour. Spread a thin layer of sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a border for the crust. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and add your desired toppings.</li>
<li>Bake: Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 8-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
<li>Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven, garnish with fresh basil if using, slice, and serve immediately. </li>
